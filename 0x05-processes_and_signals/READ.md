# 0x05 Processes and Signals

## Overview
This project focuses on understanding processes and signals in the context of Unix-like operating systems. It includes Bash scripts, explanations, and examples demonstrating the handling of processes and signals in a Linux environment.

## Contents
1. **display_pid.sh**: Bash script that displays its own Process ID (PID).
2. **signal_handling.sh**: Illustrates handling signals such as SIGTERM, SIGINT, and custom signals in a Bash script.
3. **process_info.sh**: Script to retrieve and display information about a specific process by its PID.
4. **process_monitor.sh**: Monitors a specific process by its name and displays information periodically.

## Usage
1. Ensure proper permissions for executing the Bash scripts: `chmod +x script_name.sh`.
2. Run the scripts by typing `./script_name.sh` in the terminal.
3. Follow on-screen prompts or check the script comments for more information on usage.
